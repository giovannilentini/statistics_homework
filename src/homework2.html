            <section class="homework-content">
                <p class="intro-paragraph">This homework explores the fundamental concepts of datasets and distributions in statistics, demonstrating practical applications through univariate and bivariate analysis on a sample database of people.</p>

                <h3>What is a Dataset</h3>
                <p>A dataset is a structured collection of related data, typically organized in rows and columns, that represents information about a specific domain or category. In the context of statistics and data analysis, a dataset serves as the foundation for extracting insights, identifying patterns, and making informed decisions.</p>

                <p>Each row in a dataset corresponds to an observation or record, while each column represents a variable or attribute that describes a characteristic of the data. For example, in a dataset containing information about students, each row might represent an individual student, and the columns could include attributes such as name, age, grade, and test scores.</p>

                <p>Datasets can be classified into several types based on the nature of their variables. Numerical datasets contain quantitative data that can be measured and analyzed using mathematical operations, such as temperature readings or sales figures. Categorical datasets contain qualitative data representing discrete categories or groups, such as gender, city, or occupation. Time series datasets record observations over time to identify trends and patterns, while mixed datasets combine both numerical and categorical variables.</p>

                <p>The importance of datasets in modern statistics cannot be overstated. They provide the raw material necessary for statistical analysis, enable the training and testing of machine learning models, support data-driven decision making across industries, and facilitate reproducibility and benchmarking in research. Well-structured datasets with clear variable definitions and consistent formatting are essential for accurate analysis and meaningful interpretation of results.</p>

                <h3>Understanding Distributions</h3>
                <p>A distribution in statistics describes how values of a variable are spread or distributed across different possible outcomes. It provides a comprehensive picture of the data by showing which values occur most frequently, how values cluster around central points, and how widely values vary from the center. Understanding distributions is fundamental to statistical analysis because they reveal underlying patterns in data and inform the selection of appropriate analytical methods.</p>

                <p>Distributions can be characterized by several key properties. The central tendency indicates where the center of the distribution lies, typically measured by the mean, median, or mode. The dispersion or spread describes how scattered the values are, measured by metrics such as range, variance, and standard deviation. The shape of the distribution indicates whether it is symmetric, skewed to the left or right, or exhibits other patterns such as multiple peaks.</p>

                <p>Common types of distributions include the normal distribution, which is symmetric and bell-shaped with most values clustering around the mean; the uniform distribution, where all values have equal probability; the binomial distribution, which models the number of successes in a fixed number of trials; and the exponential distribution, often used to model time between events.</p>

                <p>Distributions can be analyzed at different levels depending on the number of variables considered simultaneously. Univariate distributions examine a single variable in isolation, describing its central tendency, spread, and shape. Bivariate distributions examine two variables together, exploring relationships and dependencies between them. Multivariate distributions extend this to three or more variables, revealing complex interdependencies in high-dimensional data.</p>

                <h3>The People Dataset</h3>
                <p>For this analysis, we work with a dataset containing information about ten individuals. The dataset includes seven variables: a unique identifier (id), first name, last name, age, gender, city of residence, and email address. This dataset was created using the following SQL table definition:</p>

                                <h3>Univariate Distribution Analysis</h3>
                <p>Univariate analysis examines a single variable at a time, focusing on describing its distribution without considering relationships with other variables. This type of analysis is fundamental for understanding the basic characteristics of each variable in the dataset, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and the overall shape of the distribution.</p>

                <h4>Analysis 1: Age Distribution</h4>
                <p>The age variable is a numerical continuous variable that represents the age of each person in years. We can analyze its distribution using descriptive statistics and visualization techniques. The following SQL query retrieves basic statistical measures for the age variable:</p>

    STDDEV(age) AS std_deviation
FROM people;</code></pre>
                </div>

                <p>The query produces the following results:</p>

                <p>This result shows that the dataset contains 10 records with a mean age of 26.5 years, a minimum age of 22 years, and a maximum age of 31 years. The standard deviation of approximately 3.03 years indicates that ages are clustered fairly closely around the mean, suggesting a homogeneous age distribution within this sample.</p>

                <h4>Analysis 2: Gender Distribution</h4>
                <p>The gender variable is a categorical variable with two distinct values: Male and Female. Analyzing the distribution of a categorical variable involves counting the frequency of each category and calculating the proportion each category represents in the dataset.</p>

                <h3>Bivariate Distribution Analysis</h3>
                <p>Bivariate analysis examines the relationship between two variables simultaneously. This type of analysis is crucial for understanding how variables interact with each other, identifying correlations, and discovering patterns that would not be apparent when examining variables in isolation. Bivariate analysis can involve two numerical variables, two categorical variables, or one of each type.</p>

                <h4>Age and Gender Relationship</h4>
                <p>Analyzing the relationship between age and gender allows us to determine whether there are systematic differences in age distribution between males and females in our dataset. This type of analysis combines a numerical variable (age) with a categorical variable (gender).</p>

                <p>This analysis provides insights into how age and gender are jointly distributed across the dataset. The results show that the youngest age group (22-25 years) is predominantly female (3 females vs 1 male), the middle age group (26-29 years) is equally balanced (2 females and 2 males), and the oldest age group (30+ years) contains only males (2 individuals). This granular view reveals patterns such as the concentration of younger females and the presence of older males in the sample.</p>
                                <h3>Cryptographic Analysis: Caesar Cipher and Frequency Attack</h3>
                <p>In this section, we explore classical cryptography by applying the Caesar cipher to the first canto of Dante's Divine Comedy and then attempting to decrypt it using frequency analysis. This demonstrates how statistical methods can be used to break simple substitution ciphers, a technique that has been fundamental in cryptanalysis for centuries.</p>

                <h4>The Caesar Cipher</h4>
                <p>The Caesar cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar who used it to protect military communications. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. While extremely simple, the Caesar cipher provides an excellent introduction to cryptographic concepts and vulnerabilities.</p>

                <h4>Step 1: Text Extraction and Preparation</h4>
                <p>The first step is to extract the text from Dante's Inferno Canto I and prepare it for analysis. We remove numbers, punctuation, and normalize the text to contain only alphabetic characters. This preprocessing is essential for accurate frequency analysis.</p>

                <h4>Step 3: Frequency Analysis - Italian Language</h4>
                <p>To break the Caesar cipher, we use frequency analysis based on the known letter frequencies in the Italian language. Italian has a characteristic frequency distribution where E, A, and I are the most common letters. By comparing the frequency distribution of the ciphertext with expected Italian frequencies, we can deduce the shift value.</p>

                <h4>Results and Analysis</h4>
                <p>The frequency analysis attacks successfully recovered the original shift value of 7. Both approaches‚Äîusing standard Italian letter frequencies and using the ciphertext's own frequency distribution‚Äîwere able to decrypt the text. This demonstrates a fundamental weakness of the Caesar cipher: it preserves the statistical properties of the plaintext, making it vulnerable to frequency analysis.</p>

                <p>The chi-squared test provided a quantitative measure of how well each potential shift matched the expected Italian frequency distribution. The shift that produced the lowest chi-squared value corresponded to the correct decryption. This mathematical approach to cryptanalysis illustrates how statistical methods are essential tools in modern cybersecurity and cryptography.</p>

                <p>Key observations from our analysis:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Caesar cipher maintains the relative frequency of letters, only shifting their positions in the alphabet</li>
                    <li>Frequency analysis exploits the non-uniform distribution of letters in natural language</li>
                    <li>The chi-squared statistic provides an objective measure for comparing frequency distributions</li>
                    <li>Even with a small sample size (one canto), the frequency distribution is sufficient for successful cryptanalysis</li>
                    <li>Modern encryption algorithms must not preserve statistical properties of the plaintext to resist frequency analysis attacks</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This analysis demonstrates why the Caesar cipher, despite its historical significance, is completely insecure by modern standards. Any substitution cipher that preserves frequency information is vulnerable to statistical attacks, highlighting the importance of designing cryptographic systems that thoroughly obscure plaintext patterns.</p>
